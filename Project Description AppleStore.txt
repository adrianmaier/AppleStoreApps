-- *** insight: our developer can check these top performing apps of each genre to try emulate these 



*** RECOMMENDATIONS ***

1. Paid apps have better ratings
2. Apps with 10 to 30 language support have better ratings, so focusing on the right languages is key
3. Finance and book apps have low ratings, so in these areas user needs are not fully met, so as market opportunity to target -> potential for high user ratings and market penetration
4. Apps with a longer description have better ratings
5. A new app should aim for a rating above 3.5 as 3.5 is the average rating of all apps
6. Games and entertainment have high competition, a very high volume of apps suggesting the market may be saturated. Entering these spaces might be challenging due to high competition. However, it suggests a high user demand in these sectors.
